# Sucrose

SugarCRM's Chart Library: based on [D3](http://d3js.org) and derived from [NVD3](http://nvd3.org/).

## Building

1. Clone this repo
1. Go to the cloned repo directory (./sucrose)
1. Run `npm i --save-dev` to install node modules needed for building source code
1. Run the make commands: `make clean` and then `make all`
1. Verify that the files sucrose.js, sucrose.min.js, sucrose.css, and sucrose.min.css are still in the repo directory

## Using

1. Include a link tag to the sucrose.min.css in you document head
1. Include a script tag to the sucrose.min.js at the bottom of your document

### Notes
This library is dependent on the [D3](http://d3js.org) library so you will need to include that library before Sucrose.
